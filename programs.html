							<h2>Admission Process</h2>
						</header>
						<p>We are proud to be counted as one of the best colleges in Dehradun. We have tailored our admission process which is very systematic and transparent. We may have some of our seats vacant, but we never compromise on eligibility and terms of admissions. Our admission process in all the courses is such that 15% seats are allocated /reserved for management quota through direct counselling, 25% seats are filled on the basis of merit and central counselling at Institute while remaining 60% seats are filled on the basis of Common Entrance Test (AGI CET 2019). which purely relies on merit.. </p>
